# Frank Cat-cher of Mice
 
This was made as a submission for Low Effort Jam 4. The jam lasted a 3 days and the theme was cats. The game is about a cat named Frank who has to catch mice (go figure). The way it works is that there are three mice holes and three cheeses. A mouse will come out of a random hole, go to a cheese, and go back to a random hole. If the mouse makes it back to the hole after get some cheese, the owner's anger level will go up, and if he gets too angry he will kick Frank out. However if Frank catches a mouse he will get a point. The objective of the game is to get as many points as you can. As you play, the owner will give you feedback, positive, if you do good, and negative, if you do bad. 

Fun Fact: This was my first 3-Day Game Jam.
